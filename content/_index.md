# About Me

Hello, I'm Pulkit Mishra, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from the Indian Institute of Information Technology. My primary focus is on production ML and applied research, with a special interest in computer vision and video analytics.

Currently, I am part of the video analytics team at Jio Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence. Previously, I have worked as a Machine Learning Research Assistant at skit.ai, where I developed text-to-speech systems, and before that as a Machine Learning Intern at Hike Messenger, where I worked on generation of 3D avatars of human head in real-time. Additionally, I have interned at three other startups, where I trained deep learning models for quick PoCs and put some into production.

I strongly believe in open source and have actively contributed to several projects. I was a Google Summer of Code student, where I worked on creating an open-source version of AWS' Rekognition system and continued to mentor the project for the next two years. I also served as an Open Source Fellow with Major League Hacking, where I contributed to Facebook's Pysa library.

I love hackathons and developing innovative solutions. I have had the honor of winning several hackathons, including the Smart India Hackathon, where I led a team in building solutions for the Government of Goa.
